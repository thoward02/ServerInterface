# ServerInterface
This is another demo project I am working on to further understand CPP and server networking

# Idea
Every seen google classroom? Yeah think of that but for eSport coaching.

# Login Section 
I am currently developing the login section, which will operate via a POST http request to a server (which will compute if the user has entered in a valid uname and pword).

The left side is the actual login, the right side will be information on the program.
